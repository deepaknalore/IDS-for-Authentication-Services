Stuffing:

Prepare the leaked password -> L_A - L_U + (tunable)0.1 * L_U

Tweaking:

L_A => L_A - L_U + (tunable)0.1 * L_U -> tweaking (Remove only the username and password)

Optimization -> Maybe assume -> valid usernames -> Find valid users and then tweak password

Optimized: L_A =>(tunable)0.1 * L_U -> tweaking (Valid

U, W1, W2, W3 -> W2 and W3 go in a round-robin fashion

W1-> Actual Password for the service
0.1*W1 -> Leak  -> Tweak them -> Compare them with W2 and W3

Tweaking W1 -> Comparing W2
Tweaking W2 -> Comparing W1

L_A => L_A + some passwords are duplicated (40%) (only 1 password per user)
L_A => L_A - L_U + Some Usernames (10%)
